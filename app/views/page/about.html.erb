		<h1>About Alpha City</h1>
		<p>With rapidly increasing population densities, various resource shortages and climate change, the need for long-term sustainable urban development is now vital to ensuring a communityâ€™s prosperity. This project aims to use scenario planning to educate, communicate, and discover better methods of metropolitan improvement.
			Alphacity is a 3D browser based game, designed to inform users about the impact and function of town planning on a city or precinct. Using real-time, multi-player online technologies, users will make key decisions in their municipality and observe realistic feedback on how this might effect an actual urban environment.</p>
